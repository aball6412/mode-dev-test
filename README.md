12ish hours

# Back End Details
#### Database:
Simple MySQL DB with two columns:
+ addresses 
+ timestamp

*I know having a unique ID field is pretty standard but for this simple app I didn't add one (plus technically the email field could be a unique ID)

#### Serverside Scripting:
PHP was used for server scripting with an Apache server.

+ Javascript
+ PHP
+ MySQL
+ JQuery
+ Bootstrap

+ HTML

# Room for Improvement
There are a few of main things that I would improve going further. The first is the lightbox. There is probably a cleaner way that I could have implemented that and allowed it to be a tiny bit more responsive (though I do believe that it is decently responsive). For example, I couldn't figure out a great way to vertically center the light box since it didn't have a definitive height. So on smaller screens it floats towards the bottom instead of the middle.

The second improvement that I would pursue is for the email box line. When going through different screen widths I feel like it jumps around in size too much and I think it would be better served to have the input bar and the button be a specific width rather than a percentage of it's parent div.

Third, I can improve my understanding of how non-native fonts work in a project. When adding the correct fonts I was never completely sure that I was doing it properly so that is definitely an important area that I would like to understand better.

Finally, I think that I could do a better job of structuring my CSS code. Towards the end of the project there were times when I felt like it had gotten too big and unorganized so I feel like there is much room for improvement in that regards. Perhaps having a different CSS document for each section of the site might be a better approach to take in the future.

I think in general I can improve upon my CSS skills. I'm sure that there are simpler ways to accomplish some of the site features than how I approached the problem. For example, when the screen size was under 768 pixels I moved the MATTR logo from the nav bar to the main header section with javascript. I'm sure I could have accomplished that task more easily with some type of media query or other technique.

# What I did Well
I feel like I have a great understanding of how both the front and back end of a web application work together to produce one seamless experience. When I have created full stack applications in the past I was using the MEAN stack for the most part. But because I knew how a stack in general tied together and understood some basic programming fundamentals it was not too terribly difficult to program this with the LAMP stack.

Furthermore, I'm very comfortable using javascript to solve a variety of problems. As mentioned above I fell back on using javascript to solve different screen sizing problems rather than CSS (because I enjoy javascript so much I think that I turn to that first to solve most issues.)

I think that I did well on sticking to the specs and having the site respond appropriately to the different screen sizes. Of course there are some minor differences, but in general I believe I used good attention to detail and delivered a solid replica of the PSD file provided.
