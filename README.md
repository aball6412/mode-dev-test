# Back End Details
PHP used for the back programming on the Apache server. MySQL database used to house user information. The database is a simple one that consists of two columns "addresses", and "timestamp." Generally, there would be a unique id to go along with it but in this simple example I left it off (though technically the email address could be a unique id.)

# Front End Details

+ Javascript
+ PHP

# Room for Improvement
I think the CSS on the email bar could be improved. I think that I may be a better aproach to have a fixed bar regardless of screen size rather than having it change sizes.

Also I think I could probably structure my code in general (especially in the CSS document) in a better way. There were times where I felt like it got too big and unorganized. I'm not sure what a normal approach is to organization of CSS but I imagine that there is much room for improvement there.
